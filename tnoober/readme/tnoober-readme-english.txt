//  1. Introduction  //
///////////////////////

Are you looking for adventure, romance, quests, character development? Then you have downloaded the wrong mod. If you are looking to laugh and giggle like a school girl, the, you have downloaded the right mod.
The Sword of Noober introduces a brand new sword to the game. This sword talks too much, is overly powerful, and is pretty useless, but it might make you laugh or even smile.


////////////////////////
//  2. Compatibility  //
////////////////////////

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!

///////////////////////
//  3. Installation  //
///////////////////////

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file). On successful extraction, there should be a tnoober folder and a setup-tnoober.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click setup-tnoober.exe and follow the instructions on screen.

Run setup-tnoober.exe in your game folder to reinstall or un-install the mod.

//  6. Versions History  //
///////////////////////////

Version 2.1.0 (July 10, 2020)

Version 2.0.0 (November 17, 2019)
- Added tnoober.ini metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".

Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.
